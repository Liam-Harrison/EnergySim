# What is EnergySim
EnergySim is my attempt to recreate the commonalities of electrical systems in games, specifically sandbox games such as Oxygen Not Included, which is where the basis of the code comes from and attempts to replicate.

The network system can be extended to support a variety of items and is not exclusive to electricity, it could be used to simulate water for example without much extension.

The view can be smoothly translated, zoomed, and the objects interacted with, which allows the user to experiment with different configurations and setups of electrical systems.
